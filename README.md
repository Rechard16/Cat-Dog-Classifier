# Cat-Dog-Classifier

## Introduction

Through image recognition of the image dataset, we hope to use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 'cat' and 'rabbit' categories.

## EDA (Pre-processing)

### 1) Data-cleansing

Removed some abnormal data, including irrelevant data and misclassified data.

### 2) Analysis of the size of photos and deciding how to best resize them

We analysed the size of pictures.

We cut the photos into size of 128*128 so that we can reduce the computing difficulty while preserving essential information of the previous photo file.

### Data skewness

We have 22497 cat pictures and  22786 dog pictures, which only have a 1.2% difference between them. 

Thus, it is not necessary to process class imbalance.

### Random selection of photos for checking

We then randomly chose 20 photos from each category to check if our process has badly influenced our raw data set.

## Display

You can try your own photo to test whether it is considered as a dog or a cat.

Open the **display_version.ipynb** and put your own photo of a cat or a dog.

```
img=cv.imread('photo3.jpg',0) #change it to your own photo name
```

Change the `photo3.jpg` to your own photo name.

Then, run the code cell by cell. The cell below will print the result.

```
#show resultï¼Œdog is 0 and cat is 1
print(prediction)
```
