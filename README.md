# Cat-Dog-Classifier

## Introduction

Through image recognition of the image dataset, we hope to use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 'cat' and 'rabbit' categories. We used CNN network. We also applied the HOG model to the code.

## Pre-process

We cut the photos into size of 128*128 for decreasing computing difficulty and reserving enough information of previous photo.

## Methodology

## Reproduction

If you want to reproduce our result, please follow the steps below:

### KNN

In KNN part, we only used the first part of our dataset with about 16000 photos.

Just run the**`KNN.ipynb`** ,similar result will be shown.



---



Before trying other methods except KNN, please run the **`Get array and label.ipynb`**   to Generate the files including **`X`,`y`,`X_train`,`y_train`,`X_test`,`y_test`**.

### HOG+SVM

Run the **`HOG_SVM.ipynb`**.

In first part, the code will generate **`hog_features_train.npy`** and **` hog_features_test.npy`**.

You can use them to reproduce the second part which check the performance of SVM with different parameters(`kernel` and `C value`).

### SIFT+SVM

Run the **`SIFT_SVM.ipynb`** .

In first part, the code will generate **`X_train_descriptors`** , **` y_train_labels`**,**`X_test_descriptors`** and **` y_test_labels`**.

However it does not performance well.( It dose not have value to reproduce.)

### SIFT+ Neural Networks

First part, same as **`SIFT+SVM`**, to obtain 4 files.

Then, run the **`SIFT_Neuret.ipynb`**.



### CNN

The folder `naive_CNN_model` contains the model of different epochs with the method of naive CNN.

The folder `difker_model` contains the model weight of different epochs with the method of using different kernels in CNN.

And `arg_10e.h5` and `arg_100e.h5` are the model weight after using argued data to train the model.

If reproducing, just run **`CNN.ipynb`**( naive CNN ) or  **`Different_Kernel.ipynb`** ( Different Kernel ) or **`Data_Arg.ipynb`**( data argumentation )

### Ensemble Learning

Run the **Ensemble_Learn_preprocess.ipynb** to obtain the training sets of models.

Move these files and the weight of best model we trained in `difker_model`(**difker_3020e.h5**) to the folder `Ensemble Learning` .

Run the  **Emsemble_learning.ipynb** in this folder to train 10 models.

Run the **Emsemble_test.ipynb** to evaluate the performance of model.

## Display

You can try your own photo to test whether it is considered as a dog or a cat.

Open the **display_version.ipynb** and put your own photo of a cat or a dog.

```
img=cv.imread('photo3.jpg',0)#change it to your photo name
```

Change the `photo3.jpg` to your own photo name.

Run the code cell by cell and the followed cell will print the result.

```
#show resultï¼Œdog is 0 and cat is 1
print(prediction)
```
